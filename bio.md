Regina Lauless Imhoff
I like knitting, programming, playing Civ games, and spending time with my son.
My son like banging pots and pans, chasing cats, and picking up leaves.
I do not like pina coladas or getting caught in the rain. 

I have 3 cats(named Lucy, Linus, and Tempest) and one dog, named Jack.
