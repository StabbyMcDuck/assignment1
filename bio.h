Programming Background:
I have tried Ruby and Clojure and some Pythong in the past.
I most enjoy working in Clojure, but I believe that's because I enjoy
the project I am working on the best.  It's a music composition written in
Clojure using Overtone.
It's a lot of fun, even if the song is still a major work in progress. :)

My favorite project in 161/162 was my final project in 162.  It was a 
Pride & Prejudice text game.

I enjoyed it because it was a non-violent video game.  I don't care for 
violence in my hobbies.  Maybe that's why music, knitting, and programming
are my main hobbies!
