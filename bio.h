Programming Background:
I have tried Ruby and Clojure and some Pythong in the past.
I most enjoy working in Clojure, but I believe that's because I enjoy
the project I am working on the best.  It's a music composition written in
Clojure using Overtone.
It's a lot of fun, even if the song is still a major work in progress. :)
